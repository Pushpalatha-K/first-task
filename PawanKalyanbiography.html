	<p>Praja Rajyam Party
Kalyan started his political career in 2008[46] as the president of Yuvarajyam,[47] the youth wing of Praja Rajyam Party which was started by his elder brother Chiranjeevi. He neither contested in elections nor did he hold any constitutional post during his days in Praja Rajyam Party. While he actively campaigned for the party, he was also hit with few health problems. Kalyan was struck with bouts of vomiting, as he was hit by a sunstroke during a roadshow at Vizag on 19 April 2009.[48] Later, in 2011, when Chiranjeevi merged his party[49] with Congress,[50] Kalyan took a break from political life,[citation needed] expressing his silent discontent with his brother's decision to merge the party,[citation needed] and started a new political party in 2014 called Jana Sena Party.

Jana Sena Party
Kalyan founded a political party named Jana Sena Party on 14 March 2014.[51] He wrote a book titled Ism which is also the ideology of the Jana Sena party.[52] He met with then BJP Prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi to discuss the issues related to both the Telugu states and extended his support.[53] He campaigned extensively for the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) and BJP alliance in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. He opposed Congress party's rule stating the slogan Congress Hatao, Desh Bachao (lit. 'Stop Congress, Save the Country' in Hindi).[54] His rallies drew what the Deccan-Journal called "huge crowds" in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.[55] In August 2017, he announced that he intended to enter full-time politics starting October 2017 once he completes his film commitments.[56]

"Pawan Kalyan's talk touched my heart. My soul said that if there are youth like Pawan Kalyan, the Telugu spirit can never die. Telangana and Seemandhra can both prosper under someone like him."

—Prime Minister Narendra Modi about Kalyan[57]
He provoked the Uddanam kidney disease crisis by various protests and a hunger strike, which was later controlled by the Government of Andhra Pradesh by constructing dialysis centers and implementing various schemes for the village.[58][59] In November 2016, Kalyan announced that Jana Sena will contest in the 2019 general elections in Andhra Pradesh.[60] He stated that he was planning to contest from all 175 legislatures of Andhra Pradesh without any alliance.[61] He opposed central government's move to privatise Dredging Corporation of India (DCI)[62] on a golden platter.[63] Kalyan led a protest march to condolence farmers who committed suicides or migrated from the drought-prone regions of Rayalaseema.[64] He opposed the TDP Government's decision on land pooling.[65] Kalyan conducted a march on the historical Dowleswaram Barrage in Rajahmundry demanding political accountability.[66] He exposed the alleged unchecked mining in the reserve forest area at Vanthada village of Prathipadu in East Godavari district.[67]

"Want Pawan Kalyan to become Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh"

—BSP Bahujan Samaj Party President Mayawati about Kalyan[68]
Kalyan has announced the Jana Sena party's 2019 election manifesto at Rajahmundry[69] public meeting with many measures to improve the lives of farmers,[70] farm labourers, women, youth, and students. His party would contest together with left parties[71] Communist Party of India, Communist Party of India (Marxist), and Bahujan Samaj Party[72] for the upcoming 2019 elections in both Telugu states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

The Jana Sena Party has contested 140 constituencies in the 2019 Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly elections. Kalyan has contested two constituencies – Gajuwaka[73] and Bhimavaram.[74] He has lost in both to candidates from YSR Congress Party.[75] His party was able to win from Razole, making it the only seat it has won in the election.[76]

Later the same year, on 3 November 2019, Kalyan led a long march in Visakhapatnam in support of construction workers against YSR Congress Party governance who have been facing unemployment due to shortage of supply of sand in Andhra Pradesh.[77]

On 16 January 2020, Kalyan has announced his party's alliance with BJP, after three years of distancing from it. Both the parties would fight together in the upcoming elections in 2024.[78] On 12 February 2020, he led a rally for justice to Sugali Preethi, a 15-year-old girl who was brutally raped and murdered, in Kurnool.[79] He demanded an inquiry by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the incident.[80]</p>

	<p>Kalyan married Nandini in 1997, one year after his film debut. In 2001, Kalyan started to be in a live-in relationship with his co-star Renu Desai and their son Akira Nandan was born in 2004.[85][86] In June 2007, Nandini filed a bigamy case on Kalyan alleging that he remarried without divorcing her. Kalyan responded by stating that he had not married Desai and a magistrate court in Visakhapatnam cleared him of the charge due to lack of evidence.[87] Subsequently, in July 2007, Kalyan filed for divorce at a family court in Visakhapatnam claiming that Nandini deserted him immediately after their marriage, which was denied by her lawyer. In August 2008, their divorce was formalized with an alimony of ₹5 crore paid by Kalyan as a one-time settlement.[88][89]

In 2009, Kalyan married Desai after eight years of live-in companionship.[89] Their daughter Aadya was born in 2010.[90] The couple parted ways in 2012 with a formal divorce. In an interview in 2018, Desai claimed that Kalyan "insisted on a divorce in spite of her initial protests." She added that Kalyan denied her request of making a public statement about their divorce.[91]

Kalyan met his third wife, Anna Lezhneva, a Russian citizen during the shoot of Teen Maar (2011).[85] They married in September 2013 under Special Marriage Act at a Sub-Registrar Office in Hyderabad.[86] The couple has a daughter Polena Anjana Pawanova and a son Mark Shankar Pawanovich.[92][93] On April 20, 2019, the Times of India published an article stating that a tollywood actress has claimed that she was manipulated, used and taken advantage of when she was emotionally weak, apparently refferring to PK.[94]</p>
